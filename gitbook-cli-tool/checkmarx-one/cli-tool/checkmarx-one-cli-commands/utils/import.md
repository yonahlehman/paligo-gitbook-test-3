# import

The `import` command is used to import vulnerability results that adhere to SARIF version 2.1.0 format from third-party security tools and services (i.e. the BYOR feature). These imported results are integrated into the Application Risk Management feature, providing organizations with a unified view of their application risk profile and enabling them to make informed decisions to secure their end-to-end application lifecycle.

The command is submitted with the `--project-name` attribute specifying the name of the Checkmarx One project that these results will be associated with. It is also submitted with the `--import-file-path` argument specifying the path to the import file.

## Usage

```
./cx utils import --project-name "<project name>" --import-file-path <file path>
```

## Flags

- --project-name — The name of the Checkmarx One Project with which the results will be associated. This must be a Project that has already been created in Checkmarx One. It can be a dedicated Project created for the import or it can be a Project for which Checmarx One scans are run. In order to be able to access the imported results, the Project must be associated with a Checkmarx One Application.
- --import-file-path — The path to the file with the sarif file. This can be a single SARIF file or a zip archive containing several SARIF files.

  Make sure that the file conforms to the guidelines described in SARIF File - Specificationst and SARIF File - Limitations.
- `---help, -h` — Help for the import command.

## Examples

```
./cx utils import --project-name "importDemo" --import-file-path .
```
