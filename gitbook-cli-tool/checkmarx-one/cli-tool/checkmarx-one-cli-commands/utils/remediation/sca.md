# sca

The `sca` command is used to automatically **remediate sca vulnerabilities**.

## Usage

```
./cx utils remediation sca [flags]
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Currently only npm dependency files (package.json) are supported for this functionality.
{% endhint %}

## Flags

- `--package-files <string>` — Path to input package files to remediate the package version.
- `--package <string>` — Name of the package to be replaced.
- `--package-version <string>` — Version of the package to be replaced.

## Examples

### Remediating a specific package

```
././cx utils remediation sca --package-files <PACKAGE-FILE-PATHS> --package <PACKAGE-NAME> --package-version <PACKAGE-VERSION>
```

```
user@laptop:/AST$ ./cx utils remediation sca --package-files /home/package.json ,/home/src/package.json --package copyfiles --package-version 1.2.1
```

If you attempt to remediate a package that doesn't exist in your project, you will receive the following response:

```
Package copyfile not found
```

If you attempt to remediate a package of an unsupported type, you will receive the following response:

```
Unsupported package manager file
```
