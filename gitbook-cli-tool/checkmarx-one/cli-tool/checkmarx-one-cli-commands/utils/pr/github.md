# github

The pr github command decorates pull requests in GitHub with results from Checkmarx One scans that were triggered by that pull request. The command must be submitted with a series of required attributes that specify the relevant repo and PR and provide the authentication credentials.

## Usage

```
./cx utils pr github --scan-id <scan-id> --token <PAT> --namespace <organization> --repo-name <repository> --pr-number <pr number>
```

## Flags

- `--scan-id` *(Required)* — The scan ID of the Checkmarx One scan that was triggered by this PR. This can be extracted from the scan result that is obtained after the pull request is scanned.
- `--token` *(Required)* — The GitHub OAuth token used for creating the decoration.
- `--namespace` *(Required)* — SCM namespace for the repository.
- `--repo-name` *(Required)* — SCM repository name.
- `--pr-number` *(Required)* — The pull request number for decoration PR.
