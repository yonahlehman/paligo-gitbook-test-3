# pr

The pr command decorates pull requests with results from Checkmarx One scans that were triggered by that pull request. The pull request comments show a list of new vulnerabilities that were introduced by the code changes as well a list of vulnerabilities that were fixed by the code changes. This feature is available for all supported SCMs, `github`, `gitlab`, `azure` and `bitbucket` (both Managed Setup and Custom Setup repos).

{% hint style="info" %}
For secured code repository environments, pr decorations can be sent via CxLink using the environment variable `CX_LINK_SERVER_HOST`.
{% endhint %}
