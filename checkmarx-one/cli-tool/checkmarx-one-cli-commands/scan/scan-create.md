# scan create

The `scan create` command enables users to **create and run new scans** in Checkmarx One.

## Usage

```
./cx scan create [flags]
```

## Scanning Source Code

The `scan create` command can be used to scan source code using the following methods:

- A compressed .zip archive
- A repository URL
- A local directory

  {% hint style="info" %}
  When you scan from a local directory, the CLI compresses the folder into a .zip archive and stores it in your system's temporary storage location until it is uploaded to Checkmarx One. When scanning from a local directory or ZIP file, the CLI supports multi-part uploads for compressed sources larger than 5 GB, up to a maximum of 6 GB. - Multi-part uploads are controlled by the `multipart_file_size` setting (chunk size in GB, range **1–5**, default **2 GB**). For configuration details, see [Checkmarx One CLI Config and Environment Variables](https://docs.checkmarx.com/en/34965-68624-checkmarx-one-cli-config-and-environment-variables.html#UUID-6c2fe558-13e9-31d8-738f-efd219cb8941_section-idm4554293728945633919364184784).

  - For sources larger than **5 GB**, it is recommended to increase the client timeout to reduce the risk of upload failures.

  {% hint style="info" %}
  Relevant only for the SCA scanner, see [Scanning SBOMs](#scanning-sboms).
  {% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
When a scan is run using multiple scanners, all scanners run in parallel.

When multiple scans are run in your account, the number of concurrent scans is specified in your account's license. This info is available under **Account Settings** > **License** > **License Plan Summary**. When the limit is exceeded, the scans are added to a queue which runs on a "first in first out" basis.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
When you scan a **folder** that contains files with unsupported file formats, those files aren't scanned.

However, you can include those files in the scan by using the **--file-include** flag.

For more details see [Scan with Inclusion of unsupported file formats](#scan-with-inclusion-of-unsupported-file-formats)
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>Supported File Extensions and File Names</summary>

By default, scans include only supported files in the .zip archive submitted for scanning. The default file filters are applied to all scans.

The following is a list of the supported extensions and file names that are included by default in scans.

To include all files from the source location in the .zip archive, regardless of whether they are included in the supported files list, use the `--skip-default-filter` flag.

## File Filters

There are three methods for applying filters to files and folders for Checkmarx One scans.

- [Filter Entire Scan: --file-filter & --file-filter-ext](#filter-entire-scan---file-filter---file-filter-ext) - exclusions are applied during the pre-scan process, so that the excluded files aren't packaged into the .zip archive and are never uploaded to Checkmarx One.
- [Filters for Specific Scanners](#filters-for-specific-scanners) - apply filters for a specific scanner during the scan process, so that the specified scanner doesn't analyze the excluded files.
- [Apply ".gitignore" Exclusions](#apply-gitignore-exclusions) - exclude files and directories from the scan based on the patterns defined in the directory's .gitignore file

{% hint style="info" %}
File filtering mechanisms operate at different stages of the scan flow:

- `--file-filter` and `--file-filter-ext` affect which files are packaged in the .zip archive and uploaded to Checkmarx One. Files excluded by these filters are removed before the archive is created and are therefore not uploaded, are not available to any scanner, and cannot be restored by scanner-specific filters or filters applied in the web application (UI).
- Scanner-specific CLI filters, as well as filters applied in the project's settings via the web application (UI), only affect which uploaded files are analyzed by individual scanners.

Filters configured in the project's settings via the web application (UI) behave the same way as scanner-specific CLI filters: they only affect which files are analyzed by a scanner and do not affect the preparation of the .zip archive.

When filters are configured in the UI:

- if **Allow Override** is disabled, scanner-specific CLI filters do not take effect.
- If **Allow Override** is enabled, scanner-specific CLI filters override the UI filters.

UI filters do not override `--file-filter` or`--file-filter-ext`. If a file is excluded by either of these flags, it is removed before the .zip archive is created and cannot be scanned by any scanner, even if it is explicitly included by a UI filter.
{% endhint %}

### Filter Entire Scan: --file-filter & --file-filter-ext

The `--file-filter` and `--file-filter-ext` flags provide the ability to filter the scanned file list as follows:

- Include files, file extensions.
- Exclude files, file extensions and folders.

The `scan create` command first applies the `--file-include` flag (or the default list of included file types) to establish the baseline of which files to include in the scan. It then further refines the file selection by applying the filters specified using `--file-filter` or `--file-filter-ext` .

**Limitation:** The `--file-filter` and `--file-filter-ext` flags work only if the scanned source code is a *directory* or a *ZIP file* (not a Git repository). However, this limitation does not apply when using the filter flags for specific scanners, see [Filters for Specific Scanners](#filters-for-specific-scanners).

#### --file-filter

The `--file-filter` flag supports wildcard-based filtering.

**Supported Functionality:**

- Use the `*` wildcard to match files.

  For example, `*.html` matches files with the `.html` extension.
- Use the `!` prefix to exclude files, file extensions, and folders.

  For example: `!*.html,!src*`

  {% hint style="info" %}
  When using `!` to exclude content, enclose the argument in single quotes.

  For example, `--file-filter '!mycompany.jar'`

  For more details see [Scan with exclusion of specific file or file type](#scan-with-exclusion-of-specific-file-or-file-type)
  {% endhint %}
- Include files and file extensions.

  For example:

  - `t*` includes all files starting with `t`.
  - `*.txt` includes all files with the `.txt` extension.

**Limitations**

- Full paths are not supported. Therefore, you can only exclude an entire top-level folder, not a specific subfolder.

  For example, for the following file structure:

  `CxONE_TEST\apps\feature1\components\..`

  `CxONE_TEST\apps2\feature1\components\..`

  `CxONE_TEST\apps2\feature2\components\..`

  You can exclude all content under `apps2`, but you cannot exclude only the content under `feature2` or a specific component.
- `.git` folders and subfolders cannot be excluded.

#### --file-filter-ext

The `--file-filter-ext` flag enables you to include or exclude files and folders using Apache Ant-style glob patterns. Ant-style glob patterns provide directory-aware, recursive matching across complex project structures.

For example:

- `**/*.java` — includes `.java` files recursively across directories.
- `!**/test/**` — excludes content under `test` directories recursively.

### Filters for Specific Scanners

The following flags are used to apply filters to SAST, IaC Security and SCA scanners respectively: `--sast-filter`, `--iac-security-filter`, `--sca-filter`. You can use these flags to specify file types.

{% hint style="info" %}
The filters for specific scanners **can** be used for all types of scans (directory, zip file or GIT repo), as opposed to `--file-filter` which does not work on GIT repositories.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
The `--sca-filter` flag is only used when the package resolution is done in the cloud (default). However, if you are using SCA Resolver to run package resolution locally, then file exclusion is done as follows: `--sca-resolver-params "--excludes <string>"`.
{% endhint %}

#### Examples

The following are some examples of how these flags can be used:

- for inclusion - `--sast-filter *.java`,
- for exclusion - `--sast-filter !*.java` or `--sca-filter !**\Dockerfile`

The following are a few examples:

- **Exclude all java files:** !\*\*/\*.java
- **Exclude all files inside a folder Test:** !\*\*/Test/\*\*
- **Exclude all files under root folder Test:** !Test/\*\*
- **Exclude just the files inside a folder leaving all subfolders content:** !\*\*/Test/\*
- **Exclude all JavaScript minified files:** !\*\*/\*.min.js

If you would like to include only files inside specific folders, you need to first do a global exclude and then you can specify the folders to include.

For example:

`--sast-filter !**/**,**/Folder01/**,**/Folder02/**` would cause the SAST scanner to run only on files inside “Folder01” and “Folder02”.

{% hint style="info" %}
For additional details about the syntax used for these filters, see [Flags](#flags). Learn more about glob patterns syntax [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glob_(programming)).
{% endhint %}

#### Filters for Container Security Scanner

Container Security has a specialized set of filter settings that enable users to configure their scans for precision and relevance. Filters can be applied to files, folders, packages and images. The following filter options are available:

- `--containers-package-filter` - Exclude packages by package name or file path using regex.
- `--containers-file-folder-filter` - Specify files and folders to be included or excluded from scans.
- `--containers-image-tag-filter` - Exclude images by image name and/or tag.
- `--containers-exclude-non-final-stages` - Scan only the final deployable image.

For additional details about the usage and syntax for these filters, see Container Security Filter Usage.

### Apply ".gitignore" Exclusions

When the flag `--use-gitignore` is submitted, Checkmarx One excludes files and directories from the scan based on the patterns defined in the directory's .gitignore file.

You can also pass the `use-gitignore` option using the global `--optional-flags` parameter.

#### Requirements

- Relevant only when scanning from a .zip file or a local directory, not when scanning from a code repository URL.
- There must be a .gitignore file present in the root directory of the repository.

<details>

<summary>Supported Patterns</summary>

The following patterns are currently supported when using the `--use-gitignore` flag:

| Pattern | Description |
|---|---|
| • src/<br>• \*\*/src<br>• src/\*\* | Each of these patterns ignores any directory named 'src' regardless of its location or contents. |
| application-jira.yml | Ignores a specific file named application-jira.yml |
| \*.yml | Ignores all files ending with .yml extension |
| LoginController\[0-3\].java | Ignore files has names with a single digit 0 to 3 at the end, like LoginController0.java or LoginController1.java |
| LoginController\[!0-3\].java | Ignore files has names with a single digit except 0 to 3 at the end, like LoginController4.java or LoginController5.java |
| LoginController\[01\].java | Ignore files has names with a single digit 0 or 1 at the end, like LoginController0.java or LoginController1.java |
| LoginController\[!456\].java | Ignore files has names with a single digit except 4,5 or 6 at the end, like LoginController0.java or LoginController1.java |
| ?pplication-jira.yml | Ignores files with any single character prefix before pplication-jira.yml |
| a\*cation-jira.yml | Ignores files starting with a and ending with cation-jira.yml |

</details>

<details>

<summary>Not Supported Patterns</summary>

The following patterns are not supported due to limitations in relative or recursive path handling, such as recursive wildcards (\*\*) or relative paths:

{% hint style="info" %}
All patterns that are not supported via .gitignore are also not supported using `--file-filter`.
{% endhint %}

| Pattern | Description |
|---|---|
| /webapp/.jsp | Ignores .jsp files inside any webapp folder |
| main_modules/\*\*/temp/ | Ignores all files inside any temp folder under main_modules |
| main_modules/\*\*/.js | Ignores all .js files under main_modules at any depth |
| /application-jira.yml | Ignores only the root-level application-jira.yml |
| /config/.yml | Ignores .yml files inside the root-level config folder |

</details>

## Checkmarx SCA Resolver

Checkmarx SCA Resolver is an on-prem utility that enables you to resolve and extract dependencies and fingerprints from your source code and send them to the Checkmarx One SCA scanner for risk analysis. This enables you to run a comprehensive SCA scan without the need to send your actual source code to the cloud. It also enables you to scan private (local) dependencies that aren’t accessible to the Checkmarx SCA cloud platform. For Checkmarx One users, Resolver is used in Offline mode for dependency resolution and the results file is then sent for analysis via your Checkmarx One account.

In order to use the SCA Resolver with the Checkmarx One CLI, you need to download the Checkmarx SCA Resolver separately in a location that the Checkmarx One CLI can find. Find the latest download at Checkmarx SCA Resolver Download and Installation.

To use the SCA Resolver, you need to add the **--sca-resolver** flag to your command line with an argument with the path to your local installation of the Resolver executable. See example below, [Scan using SCA Resolver](#scan-using-sca-resolver).

{% hint style="warning" %}
When running a CLI scan that uses SCA Resolver, the source code must be in a local folder, not in a zip archive or a code repository.
{% endhint %}

The Delta Scan feature will run by default on the CxOne CLI (since version 2.3.44) scans using SCAResolver (since version 2.13.3). To disable this feature, use the **--sca-resolver-params** flag with the argument **--disable-delta-scan**. For more information on this feature, see [Delta Scans](../../../scanners/sca-scanner/README.md).

To add additional arguments to Checkmarx SCA Resolver, use the flag **--sca-resolver-params** with any additional arguments that you need. If necessary to use spaces and/or quotes, wrap the arguments in double quotes and use single quotes inside the value. For a complete list of SCA Resolver configuration arguments, see Checkmarx SCA Resolver Configuration Arguments.

{% hint style="info" %}
Only arguments that can be used in **Offline** mode can be applied to scans run via the Checkmarx One CLI Tool and plugins.
{% endhint %}

<details>

<summary>Alternative Method</summary>

There is an alternative method that offers maximum control over the files being sent to the cloud for analysis. This is done by first running a scan using Resolver in offline mode on-prem. You can then run the scan create command in Checkmarx One and provide only the results file for upload. The following procedure describes this method.

1. Run SCA Resolver in offline mode and save the results to a file named `.cxsca-results.json` (precise name required) in the root path of your Checkmarx One CLI.

   ```
   ./ScaResolver offline -r "./cx-results/.cxsca-results.json" -s "%LOCATION_PATH%"
   ```
2. Run the `scan create` command in Checkmarx One, with the `-s` argument pointing to the folder where the Resolver results file was saved. For `--scan-types`, specify only `sca`.

   ```
   ./cx scan create -s "./cx-results/" --project-name "DemoProject" --branch "DemoBranch" --scan-types "sca"
   ```

</details>

For more information about using SCA Resolver in Checkmarx One CI/CD integrations, see Using SCA Resolver in Checkmarx One CI/CD Integrations.

## Threshold

Configuring thresholds enables users to specify a threshold of vulnerability severities that, when found in a scan, will cause Checkmarx One to return a fail code for the scan. Users can then configure pipelines to break builds upon scan failure, so that scans that hit the threshold will break the build.

The threshold option supports a shorthand syntax with the format being a semi-colon separated list of key-value pairs.

The format for thresholds is **\<engine>-\<severity>=\<limit>**

- Options for **engine**: sast, iac-security, sca, api-security, containers, sscs-secret-detection, sscs-scorecard
- Options for **severity**: Critical, High, Medium, Low, Info (Info is only for SAST engine)
- Options for **limit**: A number equal to or greater than 1

More than one threshold can be defined for each engine and thresholds can be set for multiple engines. Multiple thresholds should be separated by a semi-colon. An OR operator is applied, so that if any one of the thresholds is reached the scan will fail.

For example, to set the threshold for SAST as 10 high severity or 20 medium severity vulnerabilities, and for SCA as 10 high severity vulnerabilities, use the following syntax:

```
--threshold "sast-high=10; sast-medium=20; sca-high=10; containers-high=5"
```

{% hint style="info" %}
If a `--filter <string>` is applied to the `scan create` command, then the threshold applies with respect to the filtered vulnerability count.

**For example**:

If recurrent vulnerabilities are not a concern, you can set the filter to `status=NEW`, so that only `NEW` vulnerabilities are counted when determining whether the threshold was reached.
{% endhint %}

## Reports

You can generate reports for the scan results as part of the `scan create` command.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can also generate reports for previous scans using the [results show](../results/results-show.md) command.
{% endhint %}

There are two main types of reports:

- **Scan summary report** - gives a summary of the scan results, including the number of risks of various types and severity levels that were identified by the scan. This type of report is available in HTML, json, console and markdown format.
- **Complete scan report** - a comprehensive report showing details about each of the risks identified in the scan. This type of report can be generated in json, sarif or sonar format.

  {% hint style="info" %}
  Reports generated via the CLI use the standard scan report format. There is a newer type of customized scan report that can be generated via [API](https://checkmarx.stoplight.io/docs/checkmarx-one-api-reference-guide/branches/main/ci2py4oc7hlt3-improved-reports-service-rest-api) or from the web application.
  {% endhint %}

You can also generate PDF reports, for which you can specify which sections you would like to include in the report. In addition, for PDF reports, you can specify one or more email recipients who will receive an email with a download link for the report.

To generate a report as part of the `scan create` command, add the `--report-format` flag, specifying the format you would like to generate.

For PDF reports, use the following flags to specify email recipients and to specify which sections to include in the report.

```
./cx scan create --project-name <Project Name> -s <path> --branch <branch name> --report-format pdf --report-pdf-email <recipient_email> --report-pdf-options <specify_sections>
```

For information about the content of scan reports, see Scan Reports and .

### SBOM Reports

You can generate SBOM reports for the open source packages identified in your project by the SCA scanner. Reports can be generated in [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/specification/overview/) and [SPDX](https://spdx.dev/about/) formats, with additional “property” fields showing supplemental risk data. The reports can be exported in XML (for CycloneDX only) or JSON format. You can generate SBOM reports for Checkmarx One projects on which the SCA scanner has run. For more info about Checkmarx SBOMs, see SBOM Reports.

Example for generating a CycloneDX SBOM report in JSON format:

```
./cx scan create --project-name <Project Name> -s <path> --branch <branch name> --report-format sbom --report-sbom-format CycloneDxJson
```

#### Generating an SBOM During Dependency Resolution

As an alternative to generating an SBOM from a completed SCA scan, you can use SCA Resolver together with the `--sbom-first` argument under `--sca-resolver-params` to generate a CycloneDX 1.7 SBOM immediately after dependency resolution completes. This approach can significantly reduce the time required to produce an SBOM because it does not require waiting for scan results.

{% hint style="info" %}
**Version requirements**: This capability is supported in Checkmarx One CLI version 2.3.54 and later, together with SCA Resolver version 2.14.3 and later.
{% endhint %}

To generate an SBOM while performing dependency resolution:

```
./cx scan create --project-name <Project Name> --scan-types sast,sca -s <path> --branch <branch name> --sca-resolver <path-to-resolver> --sca-resolver-params "--sbom-first"
```

The generated SBOM includes both manifest-resolved and binary-detected components and is written to the configured output directory.

{% hint style="info" %}
You can customize the generated SBOM file name and output location using the `--sbom-output-name` and `--sbom-output-path` SCA Resolver optional arguments. For more information, see Optional Arguments.
{% endhint %}

You can also generate an SBOM without running a scan by combining the `--sbom-first` argument with the `--no-scan` flag:

```
./cx scan create --project-name <Project Name> --scan-types sast,sca -s <path> --branch <branch name> --no-scan --sca-resolver <path-to-resolver> --sca-resolver-params "--sbom-first"
```

This command performs dependency resolution and generates an SBOM without submitting a scan to Checkmarx One.

## Container Security Scans

When running scans via the CLI you can choose to scan the project files in order to analyze the Dockerfile in your project or you can submit specific images for scanning.

### Authentication for Scanning Private Repos

In order to access private repos you need to be authenticated in your container repo at the time that you run the scan via Checkmarx One CLI.

{% hint style="info" %}
In addition, even when using public repos in DockerHub there is an advantage to authenticating your user in order to avoid the limits that apply to anonymous requests to public repos.
{% endhint %}

Authentication can be done via Docker or Podman.

Before running the scan, it is recommended to verify that you are able to access the image on your local machine.

For details about authentication for specific registries, see Authentication for Scanning Registries Locally.

<details>

<summary>Example - DockerHub Authentication</summary>

For DockerHub authentication make sure that your environment variables are set as:

- *DockerhubUsername* - your username
- *DockerhubToken* - your password or authorization token

</details>

### Scan Procedure

1. Run the `scan create` command with all required parameters, and specify `container-security` in the `--scan-types`.

   ```
   ./cx scan create --project-name <Project Name> -s <Repository URL> --branch <branch name> --scan-types container-security
   ```
2. If you want to scan only specific images (not an entire project), do the following:

   1. Create a "dummy" folder in your project (for use in the `-s` parameter) and give it a name that indicates that it is used for scanning images, e.g., scan_ecr_image.
   2. In the CLI scan command, for the `-s` parameter give the path to the "dummy" folder that you created, e.g., `/Users/DemoUser/scan_ecr_image`.
3. Add the `--container-images` flag followed by a comma separated list of images. Specify each image using the following syntax {image_name}:{image_tag}.

   ```
   ./cx scan create --project-name <Project Name> -s <Repository URL> --branch <branch name> --scan-types container-security --container-images "mycompany/myimage:myimagetag"
   ```

   {% hint style="info" %}
   For additional details about precise syntax for container references, see Scanning Specific Images and [Scanning Container Images via Checkmarx One CLI - Flag Validation and Best Practices](../../../scanners/container-security/scanning-container-images-via-checkmarx-one-cli---flag-validation-and-best-practices.md).
   {% endhint %}

## Running Secret Detection and Repository Health Scans

When running a scan via the CLI tool, the [Secret Detection](../../../scanners/secret-detection/README.md) and [Repository Health (OSSF)](../../../scanners/repository-health-ossf-scorecard/README.md) scanners are grouped together under Software Supply Chain Security (SCS) scanner.

{% hint style="info" %}
When running the Scorecard scanner, it is mandatory to submit the repo url and an access token with at least read permissions for that repo.
{% endhint %}

**To run a Secret Detection and Repository Health scan:**

1. Prepare the command to run a scan, using the `scan create` command and specifying the project name, branch and zip file location or repository URL using the `--project-name` , `--branch` and `-s` flags.

   ```
   ./cx scan create --project-name <Project name> --branch <branch name> -s <path to zip archive>
   ```
2. By default, all licensed scanners are run, including SCS (assuming that all mandatory SCS parameters are specified). If you are using the `--scan-types` flag to specify the scanners that run, you need to explicitly include the `scs` scanner, e.g., `--scan-types sast,scs`.
3. By default, when scs is included, both Secret Detection and OSSF Scorecard are run. If you would like to run only one of these scanners, add the `--scs-engines` flag and specify the engine that you want to run: `secret-detection`, or `scorecard`.
4. Add `--git-commit-history=<true|false>` to enable or disable scanning Git commit history for Secret Detection. Default: false. Applies only when running `--scan-types scs` with `--scs-engines secret-detection`.

   Example:

   ```
   # Run Secret Detection (default: commit history disabled)
   cx scan create \
    --project-name demo --branch main -s . \
    --scan-types scs --scs-engines secret-detection
   # Run Secret Detection with commit history explicitly enabled
   cx scan create \
    --project-name demo --branch main -s . \
    --scan-types scs --scs-engines secret-detection \
    --git-commit-history=true
   ```
5. When running the scorecard scanner, it is mandatory to add the following flags:

   - `--scs-repo-url <string>` - specifying the URL of the repo that you are scanning.

     {% hint style="warning" %}
     Even when `-s` specifies a repo url, you still need to use this flag to submit the URL for the SCS scanner.
     {% endhint %}
   - `--scs-repo-token <string>` - specifying a token with read permission on the specified repo.

     {% hint style="info" %}
     This flag is required for both private and public repos.
     {% endhint %}
6. If you would like to generate a scan report (optional), add the `--report-format` flag, specifying the desired format (e.g., `--report-format json`). For more information about scan reports, see [here](https://docs.checkmarx.com/en/34965-68643-scan.html#UUID-a0bb20d5-5182-3fb4-3da0-0e263344ffe7_section-idm4631465209593633552409907579).

   {% hint style="warning" %}
   PDF format is not supported for the SCS scanner.
   {% endhint %}
7. Run the scan command.

   The following is an example of a command to run SAST on a zip archive and run Scorecard on the project's repo.

   ```
   user@laptop:~/ast-cli$ ./cx scan create -s . --branch master --project-name Test111 --scan-types sast,scs --scs-engines scorecard --scs-repo-url https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop --scs-repo-token <TOKEN> --report-format json
   ```

## Scanning SBOMs

You can run an SCA scan on an SBOM file. The scan is run as a Checkmarx One project, with the source specified as an SBOM file. The SCA scanner returns comprehensive results of all risks associated with your open source packages. This enables customers who don’t want to submit their actual code, to obtain comprehensive SCA results for their project and manage the remediation via Checkmarx One.

Requirements:

- Supported file formats: json or xml following CycloneDX (v1.0-1.7) or SPDX (v2.3)
- It is mandatory to include the Package URL (purl) for each package in the SBOM. For more information about purl syntax, see [here](https://spdx.github.io/spdx-spec/v3.0/model/Software/Properties/packageUrl/).
- Only the SCA scanner can run on an SBOM

{% hint style="info" %}
For complete documentation of SBOM scanning, see [Scanning SBOMs](../../../scanners/sca-scanner/scanning-sboms.md)
{% endhint %}

**To scan an SBOM:**

1. For the `-s` parameter, submit the full path to the SBOM file.
2. For `--scan-types`, specify `sca`.
3. Add the `--sbom-only` flag.

```
./cx scan create --project-name <Project Name> -s <path_to_SBOM_file> --scan-types sca --sbom-only
```

### Exit Codes

When a scan finishes, it generates an exit code indicating whether or not the scan completed successfully. In case of failure, the exit code also indicates which scanner in particular failed.

These exit codes can be retrieved using a standard command in your shell, for example:

- Powershell - `$LastExitCode`
- CMD - `echo %ErrorLevel%`
- MAC - `echo $?`

The following is a list of possible exit codes:

<details>

<summary>Exit code - possible values</summary>

| Code | Explanation |
|---|---|
| 0 | All scanners completed successfully |
| 1 | Multiple scanners failed |
| 2 | SAST scanner failed |
| 3 | SCA scanner failed |
| 4 | IAC Security scanner failed |
| 5 | API Security scanner failed |

</details>

In addition, Checkmarx One provides a dedicated command, `results exit-code`, that retrieves detailed information about scan failures.

## Flags

{% hint style="warning" %}
Whenever a parameter value (e.g., project name, file location etc.) has a space or other special character in it, it needs to be escaped either by enclosing it in double quotes (and using only single quotes within the value) or by using an escape character. The specific syntax for escaping characters will vary depending on the command-line interface or programming language you are using.
{% endhint %}

- `--apisec-swagger-filter <string>` — Allow users to select specific folders or files that they want to include or exclude from the code scanning process. This setting applies only to the api-security scanner. Example: ./swagger.json

  {% hint style="info" %}
  This is effective both when creating a new project as well when scanning an existing project. For existing projects, the new application is added but does not overwrite previously associated applications.
  {% endhint %}

  {% hint style="warning" %}
  Adding an application to an existing project requires the permission `update-application`.
  {% endhint %}
- `--branch <string>, -b <string>` *(Required)* — Branch to scan.

  This is a required flag even when scanning from a zip archive. If the zip archive doesn't represent a specific branch, you can submit `.unknown` as the value and it will be shown in the UI as "N/A". (You should not enter `N/A` as the value, as this will be misinterpreted by the system.)
- `--branch-primary` — This flag sets the branch specified in `--branch` as the PRIMARY branch for the project.
- `--container-images <string>` — If you would like to scan specific images, submit a comma separated list of images to be scanned. Specify each image using the following syntax {image_name}:{image_tag}. For the syntax for images in specific registries, see Authentication for Scanning Registries Locally.

  {% hint style="warning" %}
  This flag can only be used when the `container-security` scanner is running, see --scan-types.
  {% endhint %}
- `--containers-exclude-non-final-stages`=boolean — Exclude all images that are not from the final stage of the build process, so that only the final deployable image is scanned.

  - The parameter also supports including/excluding folders.
  - Regex is not supported.
- `--containers-image-tag-filter <string>` — Exclude **images** by image name and/or tag.

  Syntax:

  - `image-name:image-tag` - exclude by image name and tag

  {% hint style="info" %}
  You can use wildcard (\*) at the beginning, end or both.
  {% endhint %}
- `--containers-local-resolution` — Use this flag to run the Container Security scanner locally. By default it runs in the cloud.

  This flag should be used when you need to pull images from private registries that aren't integrated with your Checkmarx One account.

- `--file-source <string>, -s <string>` *(Required)* — The path to the compressed zip file, the path to the folder, or the repository URL to scan.

  When scanning a private repository, a PAT for the repo should be provided using the following format:

  `https:/<username>:<pat>@github.com/<org>/<repo>.git`
- `--filter <string>` — Filter the list of results.

  - Use ',' to separate between multiple filters
  - Use ';' as to separate between multiple values for a given filter
  - Available filters are:

    project-names, scan-ids, tags-keys, tags-values, branches, statuses, initiators, source-origins, source-types.

  {% hint style="warning" %}
  Requires `override-policy-management` permission, otherwise the policies will be enforced even when the flag is sent.
  {% endhint %}
- `--no-scan` — Prevents CxOne scan from running after SBOM is generated locally.

  {% hint style="info" %}
  Relevant only when --sbom-first is submitted under --sca-resolver-params. Submitting this flag without --sbom-first causes an error.

  When using the `--project-name` flag, the Project name must be written in **quotes** if there is a space in the project name.

  For example: Test, Test1, "Test 1".
- `--project-private-package` NOT FULLY SUPPORTED YET *(Default: false)* — You can designate a scan as a "Private Package" and assign a package version to it. Once a private package has been scanned, info about the risks affecting that package will be identified by SCA when that package version is used in any of you projects.

  True = designate as private package.

  False = not a private package.

  When using this flag, you should also specify the package version using `--sca-private-package-version`.
- `--project-tags <string>` — List of tags to associate to projects.

  For example: (tagA,tagB:val, etc)

  {% hint style="warning" %}
  When this flag is used, the tags that are submitted overwrite any existing tags that were assigned to the project.
  {% endhint %}
- `--proxy str <string>` *(Optional)* — Proxy server to route Checkmarx One CLI network communication through.

  Format: `http://<proxy_ip>:<port>` or `http://<username>:<password>@<proxy_ip>:<port>`.

    For example: \*.java,\*.js
  - The parameter also supports including/excluding folders.
- `--sca-last-sast-scan-time <integer>` *(Default: 1)* — Specify the number of days that SAST scan results are considered valid for use in Exploitable Path (i.e., if there is no current SAST scan, how many days prior to the current SCA scan will Checkmarx One look for a SAST scan to use for analyzing Exploitable Path).

  Options: integer ≥ 1

  {% hint style="success" %}
  Only **full** SAST scans are used for Expoitable Path, results from incremental scans aren't considered.
  {% endhint %}

  {% hint style="warning" %}
