# hooks pre-commit

The **pre-commit** command is used to configure and run pre-commit secret detection scans.

For detailed information about usage and workflows, see Pre-Commit Secret Scanning.

## Usage

```
./cx hooks pre-commit [sub-command][flags]
```

## sub-commands

- `secrets-help` — Help for pre-commit secret detection.
- `secrets-ignore [flag]<string>` — Add detected secrets to the ignore list so they won't be flagged in future scans. Either add the flag `--all` to ignore all detected secrets, or the flag `--resultIds` to ignore specific secrets, specified in a comma separated list.
- `secrets-install-git-hook` — Install the the pre-commit hook for secret detection. By default the installation is done locally on the current repository. You can add the `--global` flag to install the hook globally for all of your Git repos.
- `secrets-scan` — Trigger a secret detection scan of your current project.
- `secrets-uninstall-git-hook` — Uninstall the pre-commit hook. If the pre-commit was installed globally, then the `--global` flag must be added to the uninstall command.
- `secrets-update-git-hook` — Update the pre-commit hook for secret detection to the latest version. If the pre-commit was installed globally, then the `--global` flag must be added to the update command.

## Flags

- `--all` — Used with `secrets-ignore` sub-command to ignore all detected secrets.
- `--global` — For global installation of hooks, add this flag to all sub-commands for installing, uninstalling or updating the hooks.
- `--resultIds <string>` — Used with `secrets-ignore` sub-command to ignore specific secrets. Submit a comma separated list of result IDs of the secretst that will be ignored.
- `--help` — Help for the hook commands.

                   2 | Options for proceeding with the commit:
   - Remediate detected secrets using the following workflow (recommended):
      1. Remove detected secrets from files and store them securely. Options:
         - Use environmental variables
         - Use a secret management service
         - Use a configuration management tool
         - Encrypt files containing secrets (least secure method)
      2. Commit fixed code.
   - Ignore detected secrets (not recommended):
      Use one of the following commands:
          cx hooks pre-commit secrets-ignore --all
          cx hooks pre-commit secrets-ignore --resultIds=id1,id2
   - Bypass the pre-commit secret detection scanner (not recommended):
      Use one of the following commands based on your OS:
         Bash/Zsh:
          SKIP=cx-secret-detection git commit -m "<your message>"
         Windows CMD:
          set SKIP=cx-secret-detection && git commit -m "<your message>"
