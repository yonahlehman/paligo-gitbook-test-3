# github

The `github` command retrieves the number of unique contributors for the provided GitHub repositories or organizations. Contributors are found by visiting all repositories and comparing the `author` property of each commit. Bots are counted as contributors if their commits do not have “type” as “Bot” (dependabot is correctly excluded).

The user's email is used as the unique identifier for counting distinct users. Contributors who commit from accounts with different emails will be counted as distinct contributors.

{% hint style="info" %}
This command returns a breakdown of unique contributors per repo as well as the total number of unique contributors. When a particular user contributes to several different repos, this is counted as a single contributor for the total count. Therefore, the total count will not necessarily be equal to the sum of the individual repos.
{% endhint %}
